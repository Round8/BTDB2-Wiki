# Tools 

== STUB ARTICLE ==

Please refer to the [formats page](../files/formats.md) for more information about each of the formats.

## Building the Tools
Some of the tools mentioned are contained in this repository.

To compile them, you will need the following:  
- **.NET 5 SDK**  

To compile them, clone this repository **and the submodules** (`git clone --recurse-submodules`) and simply go to the `Source` folder and run the `BuildTools.ps1` script in Powershell. When the process completes, there will be a `Build` folder created in the same directory.

If you wish to contribute to the tools and are not familiar with C# or the .NET platform, I would recommend installing **Visual Studio** for development.
